# Nerdify App

Yes, we know, nobody ever reads this... 🥱

But, if you were strong and curious enough for this, congratulations! 🎉🥳

We give you a warm welcome to Nerdify! 😊

Nerdify is a Web App made with ❤️ using two APIs to retrieve the best information of your favorite artists and albums.

Along the way, for our geek, smart and curious teacher and colleagues, there are some hidden surprises... 😉 Yeap, we really had to!

Hope you like it as much as we've liked making it!

✍️ Context on title font in dashboard:

Nothing You Could Do --> Yes, Soraia, 'IT IS WHAT IT IS'! 😈

"Nothing You Could Do' text font is based on the author's unconditional love for her family. Love that is not based on anything they could do or say. This handwriting is human, imperfect, and it is natural. Real humans don’t write perfectly neatly, and this font creates that feeling of authenticity."

Kimberly Geswein, font designer
